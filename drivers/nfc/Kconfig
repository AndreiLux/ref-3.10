config NFC_PN533
	tristate "NXP PN533 USB driver"
	depends on USB
	help
	  NXP PN533 USB driver.
	  This driver provides support for NFC NXP PN533 devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for PN533 devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (pn533).

config NFC_WILINK
	tristate "Texas Instruments NFC WiLink driver"
	depends on TI_ST && NFC_NCI
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver
	  into the kernel or say M to compile it as module.

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_QNCI
	bool "Qualcomm NCI based NFC Controller Driver for qca199x"
	depends on I2C
	select CRC_CCITT
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for QCA199x based devices.
	  This is for i2c connected version. NCI protocol logic
	  resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.

	---help---
	  Say yes if you want to change a power state of pn544 to stanby mode in Kernel.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config LGE_NFC_MULTICORE_FASTBOOT
	bool "NFC MultiThread"
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if multi thread is applied for pre-standby.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config LGE_NFC_SET_IRQ_WAKEUP
	bool "NFC Set IRQ wakeup when NFC ON"
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if Set IRQ Wakeup NFC ON.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config LGE_NFC_DEBUG_MESSAGE
	bool "NFC Debug Message"
	default n

config LGE_NFC_USE_PMIC
	bool "NFC Using PMIC Clock"
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if you want to use PMIC Clock.
	  If use XTAL or unsure, say N here.
	  Please refer to [NFC-367] for more details.

config LGE_NFC_SONY
    bool "CXD2235BGG NFC driver for kddi"
    #depends on I2C && UART
    default n
    ---help---
      Say yes if you want CDX2235AGG Near Field Communication driver.
      This is for i2c & UART connected version. If unsure, say N here.

      To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
      be called CDX2235AGG.
