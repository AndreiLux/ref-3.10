	tristate "Sensors sysfs"
	help
	  Support sysfs for sensors.
          If you say yes here you get sysfs support for
	  sensor factory test.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sensors_core.

	default n
	depends on SPI
	help
	  ssp driver for sensor hub.
          If you say yes here you get ssp support for
	  sensor hub.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ssp.

config SENSORS_SSP_SENSORHUB
	tristate "Sensors ssp sensorhub"
	default n
	depends on SPI
	help
	  ssp sensor hub driver for sensor hub.
          If you say yes here you get ssp support for
	  sensor hub.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ssp.

config SENSORS_SSP_FACTORY
	tristate "ssp factory"
	depends on SENSORS_SSP
	default n
	help
	  ssp sensor hub driver for factory test.
          If you say yes here you can enable fatory drvier for
	  factory test.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ssp.

config SENSORS_MAX86900
	tristate "MAXIM MAX86900 HRM Sensor"
	default n
	depends on I2C && SYSFS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the MAX86900
	  HRM sensor.
	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called max86900.

	  If you say yes here you get support for the MAX86902
	  HRM sensor & uv sensor.
	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called MAX86902.

config SENSOR_SSP_PROXIMTY_FOR_WINDOW_TYPE
	tristate "PROXIMITY THRESHOLD FOR WINDOW_TYPE"
	default n
	depends on SPI
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the proximity threshold
	  This threshold is changed by window type.
